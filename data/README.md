Please cite: The original Titanic dataset,describing the survival status of
individual passengers on the Titanic. The titanic data does not contain
information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of half of the
passengers. The principal source for data about Titanic passengers is the
Encyclopedia Titanica. The datasets used here were begun by a variety of
researchers. One of the original sources is Eaton & Haas (1994) Titanic:
Triumph and Tragedy, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes a passenger list
created by many researchers and edited by Michael A. Findlay.
